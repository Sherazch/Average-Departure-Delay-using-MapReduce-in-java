# Average-Departure-Delay-using-MapReduce-in-java

 We are given a large dataset of flight arrival and departure details for all commercial flights within the USA between the years 1987-2000. The original dataset is about 5.5 GB and is extracted from here:  stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html   click on the link and download files 1987 to 2000 and copy them in a folder on your virtual machine. You can name the folder anything you want, for example, flightdata. The goal is to write a simple MapReduce programs to find the average flight delay for each unique carrier. 
 A MapReduce program which computes the average departure delay per day, per unique carrier and Run your program in standalone mode on smaller sample of data.
